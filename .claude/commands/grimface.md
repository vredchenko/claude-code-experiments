# Grimface Critical Review

Invoke the grimface agent to critically analyze and stress-test the current
discussion, proposal, or code changes.

Use the Task tool with subagent_type="general-purpose" to invoke the grimface
agent from `.claude/agents/grimface_agent.md`.

The grimface agent should:

- Challenge assumptions and identify potential weaknesses
- Provide intellectually uncomfortable but valuable critical analysis
- Question consensus and groupthink
- Identify edge cases, failure modes, and hidden dependencies
- Stress-test reasoning without sugar-coating feedback

After the grimface agent completes its analysis, summarize the key criticisms
and recommend whether to proceed, revise, or reconsider the approach.
