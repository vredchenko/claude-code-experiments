# Implement Documentation Exposure for LLM Agents (AGENTS.md / llms.txt approach)

## Source Reference
- **Article**: "How to teach your coding agent with AGENTS.md" by Eric J. Ma
- **URL**: https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2025/10/4/how-to-teach-your-coding-agent-with-agentsmd/
- **Related Concept**: llms.txt for documentation indexing

## Overview
Implement a systematic approach to expose project documentation to LLM agents, ensuring they have persistent, session-spanning knowledge about project-specific preferences, tools, and conventions.

## Key Concepts from Article

### AGENTS.md Standard
- A standardized file that gets sent with every LLM API call in modern coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot)
- Provides persistent instructions across sessions
- Allows teaching the LLM about project-specific preferences
- Pattern: "Please update AGENTS.md with..." to capture learnings

### llms.txt Approach
- Repository/folder index for LLM agents
- Helps LLMs find the most relevant and up-to-date documentation
- Provides structured access to documentation

## Proposed Implementation

### Phase 1: Research & Design
- [ ] Study Eric Ma's approach in detail
- [ ] Research llms.txt format and best practices
- [ ] Evaluate AGENTS.md vs llms.txt vs hybrid approach
- [ ] Review existing `.claude/` structure for compatibility
- [ ] Document comparison with our current CLAUDE.md approach

### Phase 2: Design Documentation Structure
- [ ] Design documentation hierarchy for LLM consumption
- [ ] Define what knowledge should be exposed to agents
- [ ] Create documentation indexing strategy
- [ ] Plan integration with existing agents and skills

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Implement chosen approach (AGENTS.md, llms.txt, or hybrid)
- [ ] Create documentation generation/update workflows
- [ ] Integrate with existing `.claude/` directory structure
- [ ] Add tooling for maintaining documentation index
- [ ] Create examples for different documentation types

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test with Claude Code to verify documentation exposure
- [ ] Validate persistence across sessions
- [ ] Test with different agents (grimface, foundation, AI security agents)
- [ ] Measure improvement in agent context awareness
- [ ] Document best practices and patterns discovered

### Phase 5: Documentation & Training
- [ ] Document the approach in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Create guidelines for maintaining LLM-exposed documentation
- [ ] Add examples of teaching agents new concepts
- [ ] Create workflow for iterative documentation improvement

## Expected Benefits
1. **Persistent Knowledge**: Agents remember project-specific conventions across sessions
2. **Reduced Repetition**: No need to re-explain project patterns every session
3. **Better Context**: LLMs have structured access to all relevant documentation
4. **Scalability**: As project grows, documentation exposure grows systematically
5. **Standardization**: Following emerging industry standards for LLM-agent interaction

## Integration Points
- `.claude/` directory structure (agents, skills, commands)
- Existing CLAUDE.md project instructions
- MCP servers and their documentation
- AI security knowledge base (MITRE ATLAS, OWASP, etc.)
- Agent-specific context needs

## Open Questions
- [ ] How does this complement vs replace CLAUDE.md?
- [ ] Should we use AGENTS.md, llms.txt, or both?
- [ ] How to handle dynamic documentation (CVEs, threat intelligence)?
- [ ] Integration with MCP server documentation?
- [ ] Version control strategy for LLM-consumed documentation?

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Claude Code agents can access project documentation without prompting
- [ ] New agents can onboard to project context automatically
- [ ] Documentation updates propagate to agent context immediately
- [ ] Reduced "context loss" between sessions
- [ ] Measurable improvement in agent task completion accuracy

## Priority
**Medium-High** - This could significantly improve agent effectiveness and reduce context-building overhead.
